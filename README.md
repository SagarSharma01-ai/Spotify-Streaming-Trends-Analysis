## 🎧 Project Objective
Does your "Spotify Wrapped" tell the whole story?
This project analyzes my personal streaming history across **All Platforms (Desktop, Web, iOS)** vs. **Android Only** to uncover behavioral discrepancies. The goal was to understand how "Device Choice" impacts "Music Choice."

## 📸 Dashboard Visuals

## 💡 Key Findings

### 1. The "Mobile-First" Reality
I am a mobile-exclusive listener.
- **93.1%** of my total streaming (12,724 tracks) happens on **Android**.
- Only **~7%** occurs on Desktop/Web.

### 2. The Rock Dominance
Unlike generic pop trends, my history is dominated by Classic and Modern Rock:
- **#1 Artist:** **The Beatles** (13.6K Streams).
- **#2 Artist:** **The Killers** (6.9K Streams).

### 3. The "Desktop vs. Mobile" Discrepancy
A deep dive revealed platform-specific favorites:
- **Desktop Favorite:** The song *"Caution"* by The Killers ranks #4 globally but disappears from the Android Top 5, indicating it is a "Work Mode" anthem.
- **Mobile Favorite:** *"Concerning Hobbits"* appears only in the Android Top 5, suggesting it is used specifically for relaxation/sleep away from the desk.

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations
Based on the Year-over-Year decline in volume (Tracks down 11.49%):
1.  **Smart Shuffle:** Enable to arrest the volume decline and discover new artists.
2.  **Platform Optimization:** Create a dedicated "Desktop Focus" playlist to leverage the high-energy rock tracks preferred on PC.
